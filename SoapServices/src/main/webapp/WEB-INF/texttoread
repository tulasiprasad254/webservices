Hi 
We had a difficulty connecting to wM in the QV area yesterday, which is why the records are in the Pending status, but we rectified it and it is now operating as planned.
However, we are unsure about the CIX level upgrade because we are receiving successful responses from wM. We must inquire with wM as to why it is not replicating. 
FYI
Yesterday, the QV2 Ui pointed to the v9 schema. However, it is now linking to the v2 schema.
